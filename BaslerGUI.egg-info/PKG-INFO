        Repository contains a window application for operating Basler brand cameras, especially those equipped with the PYTHON 300 monochrome matrix, or similar.

        * auto file indexing
        * calculating and displaying the histogram
        
        Software was developed for laser speckle imaging. It has built-in functions such as calculating spatial contrast, or calculating parameters of speckle pattern variation.
