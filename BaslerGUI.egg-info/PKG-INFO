# BaslerGUI

Repository contains a window application for operating Basler brand cameras, especially those equipped with the PYTHON 300 monochrome matrix, or similar. 
Communication with the cameras is done using pypylon, the official python wrapper for the Basler pylon Camera Software Suite. Please see:
https://github.com/basler/pypylon

Software features:
* establishing connection with camera
* camera acquisition control
* capturing raw video
* capturing with ROI
* recording of several video sequences at intervals
* auto file indexing
* calculating and displaying the histogram

Software was developed for laser speckle imaging. It has built-in functions such as calculating spatial contrast, or calculating parameters of speckle pattern variation.

Software manual will be prepared soon
